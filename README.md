## 👤 About Me

I build **full-stack applications, data infrastructure, and systems utilities**,
usually with **Rust** at the core. From frontend interfaces to backend pipelines
to command-line tools, I'm exploring the entire spectrum of what's possible with
modern systems programming.

With roots in **music production** (bassist, singer, producer) and 8+ years in
**Learning & Development** (including TEFL tutoring for professionals), I've
always been driven by **expression**. The alias **"Craole"** embodies this — a
fusion of my Caribbean heritage and creative identity, reminding me that _**I
have something to say**_.

Music remains part of my voice, but **code has expanded my range**. Every system
I build, every pipeline I design, every utility I craft — it's all **expression
through structure**, blending the precision and creativity I honed as a musician
with the power of modern systems programming.

> **Code is another instrument of expression through structure** 🎵⚙️

## 🛠️ What I Build

### 🌐 Full-Stack Development

- Web applications with Rust backends (Axum, Actix) + modern frontends (HTMX,
  SPA frameworks)
- End-to-end solutions from database to UI

### 📊 Data Engineering

- High-performance data pipelines with Rust & Delta Lake
- Graph databases (Neo4j) for complex relationship modeling
- Analytics infrastructure that scales

### ⚙️ Systems Utilities

- Command-line tools that solve everyday problems elegantly
- Cross-platform applications (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Developer productivity tools

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- Declarative NixOS configurations for reproducible environments
- Infrastructure-as-code and automation
- Self-hosted solutions

## 🎯 Philosophy

Code is expression. Just like music, it requires **precision, creativity, and
purpose**. Whether I'm building a web app, designing a data pipeline, or
crafting a CLI tool, it's about solving problems in ways that feel **structured
yet innovative**.

From my musical background to teaching to building systems—it's all connected
through the desire to **create and communicate**.

## 🚀 Open to Collaboration

Looking for **Rust-centric projects** across the full spectrum:

- 🌐 **Full-stack applications** with modern Rust frameworks
- 📊 **Data engineering** pipelines and infrastructure
- ⚙️ **Developer tools** and systems utilities
- 🎨 **Creative technical** experiments
